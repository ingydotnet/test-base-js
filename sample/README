To set up a Test.Base based test suite for your JSAN module, do the
following steps:

1) Install JS, JS::Test::Simple and JS::Test::Base from CPAN.

2) Copy this directory from the Test.Base distribution to your project
   and rename it `tests` (a JSAN standard)

3) Rename `lib/Test/Sample.js` to your own local project test file. This
   is where you put any code that overrides or extends Test.Base.js

4) Run these commands:
    > cp `js-cpan Test/Base/Makefile` .
    > cp `js-cpan Test/Base/config.yaml` .

5) Edit the config.yaml file to your own values. (optional)

6) Write a bunch of test files in the t/ directory with names like
   `foo.t.js` and `bar.t.js`.

7) Run: `make clean all`

8) Point your browser at `http://your.domain/Your-Project/tests/index.html`
